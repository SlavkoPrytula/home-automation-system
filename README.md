# home-automation-system

## Router source code


This project relies on the implementation of the home automation system. The main idea is to create a system supporting ZigBee devices and connecting them to the main Hub. To implement this, we use the cc2531/30 USB stick as the coordinator. The endpoints are the supported devices
